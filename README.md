# VEuPathDB EDA Workspace Core

The VEuPathDB EDA Workspace Core is a pluggable application core that will be used to
drive the EDA and MapVEu Workspaces.

This repo uses io-ts for modeling types, and exposed a set of React Hooks. The
primary export of this application will likely be a React Component.

_This is a work in progress, so some details are subject to change._
